### üìÑ `.gitignore`

- Environmental variables (`.env` files).

>The source of this part of the `.gitignore` comes from the [official GitHub `Python.gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore).

It also ignores a few other files which are common within a **Beyonder Solutions** development environment.
- Virtual environments (`wenv*/` directories).
